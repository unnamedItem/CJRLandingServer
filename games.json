        "description": "In CATAN (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players build by spending resources (sheep, wheat, wood, brick and ore) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce wood, mountains produce ore, fields produce wheat, and pastures produce sheep.<br/><br/>Set-up includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.<br/><br/>A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.<br/><br/>Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.<br/><br/>CATAN has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.<br/><br/>Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed CATAN to better represent itself as the core and base game of the CATAN series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector&#039;s edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition. Numerous spin-offs and expansions have also been made for the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).<br/><br/>A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.<br/><br/>The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had there into the region you secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande and in the region containing the king.<br/><br/>",

As executioners pandering to the masses, the players are trying to behead the most popular nobles.  Each day the nobles are lined up and players take turns killing the ones at the front of the line until all the nobles are gone.  However, players are given cards which will manipulate the line order right before 'harvesting' heads, which is what makes the game interesting.  After three days of chopping, the highest total carries the day.<br/><br/>",

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.<br/><br/>To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in its row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. players. This change allows you to know which cards are in play, thereby allowing you to track which cards have been played and (theoretically) make better choices as to which card to play when.<br/><br/>",

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of their meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete their project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>First game in the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.<br/><br/>There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!<br/><br/>Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game play in Coloretto is simple: Either draw a card to play to a row, or take a row of cards to add them to your collection. A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.<br/><br/>Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you. Each color is scored using a triangular number system: the first card in a color is &plusmn;1 point, the second card is &plusmn;2 points, and so on. The player with the high score wins!<br/><br/>A two-player variant is included with some versions of Coloretto, with the only change being that rows can have only 1-3 cards placed in them, depending on the icons on the row cards.<br/><br/>Nordic version include extensions: 'Coloretto: The Extra Cards', 'Coloretto: The Limit Cards' and 'Coloretto for two players'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Granada, 1278. At the foot of the Sierra Nevada mountains, one of the most exciting and interesting project of the Spanish Middle Ages begins: the construction of the ALHAMBRA.<br/><br/>The best master builders in the whole of Europe and Arabia want to demonstrate their skill.  Employ the most suitable teams of builders and make sure that you always have enough of the right currency.  Because no matter whether they are stonemasons from the north or horticulturalists from the south, they all want a proper wage and insist on their &quot;native&quot; currency.  With their help towers can be constructed, gardens laid out, pavilions and arcades erected and seraglios and chambers built.<br/><br/>In Alhambra, players are acquiring buildings to be placed within their Alhambra complex.<br/><br/>The money in Alhambra comes in four different currencies and is available in the open money market.  The 54 buildings of six types become available for purchase in the building market four at a time; one building is available in each of the four different currencies.  On a player's turn, a player may 1) take money from the open money market, 2) purchase a building from the building market and either place it in his Alhambra or reserve, or 3) engage in construction and re-construction projects with buildings that have been placed in the player's Alhambra or reserve. The game rewards efficiency, as when a player purchases a building from the market for the exact amount of money, the player may take another turn.<br/><br/>Players with the most buildings in each of the six building types in his Alhambra score in each of the scoring phases, and points are awarded for players' longest external &quot;wall&quot; section within their complex. The game ends when the building market can no longer be replenished from the building tile supply, and there is a final scoring, whereupon the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Alhambra: The Dice Game (a variant in which you can combine Alhambra buildings with Alhambra dice.)<br/><br/><br/>",

It requires a steady hand -- which can be hard to maintain during the many fits of maniacal laughter! The wooden Totem sits in the middle of the table, waiting for the player with the fastest reflexes to snatch it up and win the game.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of cards. In order to win you must be the first player to get rid of all of your cards. Each turn, all of the players reveal one of their cards. If two cards are identical, those players must make a grab for the Totem. The faster player then gives their cards to their unfortunate adversary.<br/><br/>To add to the difficulty, certain cards are almost identical, which can trick a hapless player into grabbing the Totem by mistake -- a grave error. Other cards force all players to make a grab at once, change the method of play, or otherwise add to the difficulty.<br/><br/>Jungle Jam, \u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434, and Prawo D\u017cungli are unauthorized reproductions of Jungle Speed/Arriba!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take on the role of dwarves. As miners, they are in a mine, hunting for gold. Suddenly, a pick axe swings down and shatters the mine lamp. The saboteur has struck. But which of the players are saboteurs? Will you find the gold, or will the fiendish actions of the saboteurs lead them to it first? After three rounds, the player with the most gold is the winner.<br/><br/>With the help of Dwarf Cards, the players are assigned their role: either miner or saboteur. The roles are kept secret- they are only revealed at the end of the round.<br/><br/>The Start Card and the three Goal Cards are placed onto the table, each seven cards away from the start and one card between each Goal Card. The Goal Cards are placed face-down. The gold is on one of the Goal Cards, but nobody knows which.<br/><br/>Players have cards in hand. On a player's turn, he must do one of three things: place a Path Card into the mine, play an Action Card in front of a player, or pass.<br/><br/>The Path Cards form paths leading to the Goal Cards. Path Cards must be played next to a already-played Path Card. All paths on the Path Card must match those on the already-played cards, and Path Cards may not be played sideways.<br/><br/>The miners are trying to build an uninterrupted path from the Start Card to a Goal Card, while the saboteurs are trying to prevent this. They shouldn't try and be too obvious about it, however, lest they be immediately discovered.<br/><br/>Action Cards can be placed in front of any player, including oneself. Action Cards let the players help or hinder one another, as well as obtain information about the Goal Cards.<br/><br/>Once a player places a Path Card that reaches the gold, the round is over. The miners have won and receive cards with gold pieces as their reward.<br/><br/>The round is also over if the gold could not be reached. In that case, the saboteurs have won and receive the gold pieces.<br/><br/>Once the Gold Cards have been distributed, the next round begins. The game is over at the end of the third round, with the player with the most gold pieces being the winner.<br/><br/>",

Instead of placing a Meeple as usual on their turns, players can now either place a tower segment on a tile with a space for a tower, add a tower segment to a tower already standing, or place a Meeple on top of a tower (which &quot;finishes&quot; it).<br/><br/>Placing a tower segment allows you to capture other players' Meeples, so long as they are in view of the tower in an orthogonal direction.  If the tower is 1 piece high, they can capture Meeples that are within 1 tile of the tower; if the tower is 2 pieces high, they can capture Meeples within 2 tiles of the tower; etc.  Not only do players lose whatever they may have scored with that Meeple, but they also have to pay 3 victory points if they want to free their Meeple.<br/><br/>Part of the Carcassonne series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a game that takes place in a small village which is haunted by werewolves. Each player is secretly assigned a role - Werewolf, Ordinary Townsfolk, or special character such as The Sheriff, The Hunter, the Witch, the Little Girl, The Fortune Teller and so on... There is also a Moderator player who controls the flow of the game. The game alternates between night and day phases. At night, the Werewolves secretly choose a Villager to kill. During the day, the Villager who was killed is revealed and is out of the game. The remaining Villagers (normal and special villagers alike) then deliberate and vote on a player they suspect is a Werewolf, helped (or hindered) by the clues the special characters add to the general deliberation. The chosen player is &quot;lynched&quot;, reveals their role, and is out of the game. Werewolf is a social game that requires no equipment to play, and can accommodate almost any large group of players.<br/><br/>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow/les Loups-Garous de Thiercelieux/Die Werw&ouml;lfe von D&uuml;sterwald is a published version arranged by Herv\u00e9 Marly and Philippe des Palli\u00e8res and published by Lui-m\u00eame, 2001 for 8-23 players. This has been nominated for the 2003 Spiel des Jahres award.<br/><br/>Werewolves of Miller's Hollow is a separate game from Werewolf, and was split from that entry at the request of Asmodee.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE GAME CONCEPT<br/>You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.<br/><br/>OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY<br/>The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or fewer Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.<br/><br/>GAME CHARACTERISTICS<br/>The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.<br/><br/>In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.<br/><br/>Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of their staffed areas in whatever sequence they choose, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D\u00e9 with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -<br/><br/>The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. <br/> Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.<br/><br/>However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.<br/><br/>Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.<br/><br/>The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D\u00e9 Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.<br/><br/>",

We are the Resistance!<br/><br/>The Resistance is a party game of social deduction. It is designed for five to ten players, lasts about 30 minutes, and has no player elimination. The Resistance is inspired by Mafia/Werewolf, yet it is unique in its core mechanics, which increase the resources for informed decisions, intensify player interaction, and eliminate player elimination.<br/><br/>Players are either Resistance Operatives or Imperial Spies. For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust. Each round begins with discussion. When ready, the Leader entrusts sets of Plans to a certain number of players (possibly including himself/herself). Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission. Based on the results, the mission succeeds (Resistance win) or fails (Empire win). When a team wins three missions, they have won the game.<br/><br/>Rule Correction:<br/><br/>For first printing (2010 purchases), the expansion rules should read: &quot;Games of 5-6 players use 7 plot cards, games with 7+ players use all 15 Plot Cards.&quot; and &quot;...each Round, the leader draws Plot cards (1 for 5-6 players, 2 for 7-8 players, and 3 for 9-10 players)&quot; - This has been corrected in the subsequent printings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.<br/><br/>What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.<br/><br/>With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.<br/> For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Dare to discover Forbidden Island! Join a team of fearless adventurers on a do-or-die mission to capture four sacred treasures from the ruins of this perilous paradise. Your team will have to work together and make some pulse-pounding maneuvers, as the island will sink beneath every step! Race to collect the treasures and make a triumphant escape before you are swallowed into the watery abyss!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Balduin, the house ghost, found an old camera in the castle cellar. Immediately he photographed everything that he loves to make disappear when he is haunting&thinsp; &ndash; including himself, of course. Unfortunately, the enchanted camera takes many photos in the wrong colors. Sometimes the green bottle is white, at other times it's blue. Looking at the photos, Balduin doesn't really remember any more what he wanted to make disappear next. Can you help him with his haunting and quickly name the right item, or even make it disappear by yourself? If you grab the right items quickly, you have a good chance of winning...<br/><br/>The lightning fast shape and color recognition game that is sure to test the reflexes of kids, families and gamers alike. In Ghost Blitz, five wooden items sit on the table waiting to be caught: a white ghost, a green bottle, a cute grey mouse, a blue book, and a comfortable red chair. Each card in the deck shows pictures of two objects, with one or both objects colored the wrong way. With all players playing at the same time, someone reveals a card, then players grab for the &quot;right&quot; object &ndash; but which object is right?<br/><br/><br/>    If one object is colored correctly &ndash; say, a green bottle and a red mouse &ndash; then players need to grab that correctly colored object.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    If both objects are colored incorrectly &ndash; say, a green ghost and a red mouse &ndash; then you look for the object and color not represented among the four details shown. In this case you see green, red, ghost and mouse, so players need to grab the blue book.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to grab the correct object keeps the card, then reveals the next card from the deck. If a player grabs the wrong object, she must discard one card previously collected. Once the card deck runs out, the game ends and whoever has collected the most cards wins!<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Knapp daneben, released in 2004 by HABA.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pictomania is a drawing game in which everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, giving a chance for those who excel only at one or the other skill to crush the dreams of other players.<br/><br/>Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.<br/><br/>One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table than anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.<br/><br/>Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round. The player with the highest score after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

The team has only seconds to assess the situation and devise a plan of attack &ndash; then you spring into action like the trained professionals that you are. You must face your fears, never give up, and above all else work as a team because the fire is raging, the building is threatening to collapse, and lives are in danger.<br/><br/>You must succeed. You are the brave men and women of fire rescue; people are depending on you. This is what you do every day.<br/><br/>Flash Point: Fire Rescue is a cooperative game of fire rescue.<br/><br/>There are two versions of game play in Flash Point, a basic game and expert game.<br/>In both variants, players are attempting to rescue 7 of 10 victims from a raging building fire.<br/>As the players attempt to rescue the victims, the fire spreads to other parts of the building, causing structural damage and possibly blocking off pathways through the building.  Each turn a player may spend action points to try to extinguish fires, move through the building, move victims out of the building or perform various special actions such as moving emergency vehicles.  If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.<br/><br/>The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.  The game includes a double sided board with two different building plans and several expansion maps are available.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cheating is forbidden? Not in this naughty game of cards &ndash; in fact, you'll probably have to cheat in order to win.<br/><br/>In Mogel Motte you want to get rid of all the cards in your hand before anyone else. Each player starts the round with a hand of eight cards, with one player (the oldest) receiving the guard bug &ndash; which stays on the table throughout the game &ndash; and one card being turnd face-up to start a discard pile. The cards are numbered 1-5, with the majority of them having only numbers; some cards have special abilities that come into play when added to the discard pile or in a player's hand.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player places one card from her hand onto the discard pile; that card must be numbered exactly one higher or lower than the card on top of the discard pile. (The numbers wrap, so a 1 can be played on a 5 and vice versa.) If a player can't play a card, she draws one from the deck and her turn ends.<br/><br/>There's another way to rid yourself of cards, though: cheating! Throughout the round, you can make cards disappear by dropping them on the floor, hiding them up your sleeve and so on. You must keep your hand of cards above the table at all times, you can't vanish more than one card at once, and you can't rid yourself of your final card this way. The player with the guard bug &ndash; and only him! &ndash; can call out other players for cheating, and no one can cheat while the accusation is being resolved. If the accusation was false, the Guard must draw a card; otherwise the cheating player takes back the card she tried to lose, is given a card from the Guard's hand as additional punishment, and becomes the new Guard.<br/><br/>Cheating is a necessity as the &quot;Cheating Moth&quot; cards can't be played onto the discard pile, but must be disappeared via cheating. (The Guard, however, can play these cards as the Guard is not allowed to cheat.)<br/><br/>The action cards work as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Ant: After an ant is played, everyone but the active player must take a card from the draw pile.<br/>    Cockroach: After a cockroach is played, everyone races to play an identically-numbered card on top of it. Only the fastest player gets to leave her card in place.<br/>    Mosquito: After a mosquito is played, everyone but the active player must slap the pile of cards. Whoever is slowest receives a card from the hand of all other players.<br/>    Spider: After playing this, give a non-Cheating Moth card from your hand to another player.<br/><br/><br/>When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. All other players score 10 points for each Cheating Moth in hand, 5 points for each action card, and 1 point for each number card. After a number of rounds equal to the number of players, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a 4x4 grid, and to complete set up, each player takes four tiles at random, then places them in order from low to high down the diagonal that goes from upper left to lower right.<br/><br/>On a turn, you take either a face-down tile from the pile or a face-up tile from the table. You can (1) place this tile in an empty space in your grid, (2) swap this tile for a tile already in the grid, or (3) discard this tile face-up on the table. However, all tiles in your grid must obey one rule at all times: A tile must be higher in value that any tile directly above it or to its immediate left and lower in value that any tile directly below it or to its immediate right. Whoever first fills their grid with sixteen tiles wins. (If the draw pile runs out, then whoever has the most tiles in their grid wins.)<br/><br/>You can play Lucky Numbers tournament style by playing multiple games and having each player start once. The winner of a game receives 2 points, while each loser receives -1 point for each empty space in their grid.

From a deck with only sixteen cards, each player starts with only one card in hand; one card is removed from play. On a turn, you draw one card, and play one card, trying to expose others and knock them from the game. Powerful cards lead to early gains, but make you a target. Rely on weaker cards for too long, however, and your letter may be tossed in the fire!<br/><br/>Number 4 in the Setting: Tempest Shared World Game Series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are head of a family in an Italian city-state, a city run by a weak and corrupt court. You need to manipulate, bluff and bribe your way to power. Your object is to destroy the influence of all the other families, forcing them into exile. Only one family will survive...<br/><br/>In Coup, you want to be the last player with influence in the game, with influence being represented by face-down character cards in your playing area.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with two coins and two influence &ndash; i.e., two face-down character cards; the fifteen card deck consists of three copies of five different characters, each with a unique set of powers:<br/><br/><br/>     Duke: Take three coins from the treasury. Block someone from taking foreign aid.<br/>     Assassin: Pay three coins and try to assassinate another player's character.<br/>     Contessa: Block an assassination attempt against yourself.<br/>     Captain: Take two coins from another player, or block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/>     Ambassador: Draw two character cards from the Court (the deck), choose which (if any) to exchange with your face-down characters, then return two. Block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/><br/><br/>On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed above, regardless of which characters you actually have in front of you, or you can take one of three other actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Income: Take one coin from the treasury.<br/>     Foreign aid: Take two coins from the treasury.<br/>     Coup: Pay seven coins and launch a coup against an opponent, forcing that player to lose an influence. (If you have ten coins or more, you must take this action.)<br/><br/><br/>When you take one of the character actions &ndash; whether actively on your turn, or defensively in response to someone else's action &ndash; that character's action automatically succeeds unless an opponent challenges you. In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.<br/><br/>If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.<br/><br/>The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!<br/><br/>A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards. Copies in stores may not be the Kickstarter versions and may only be the base game). The Inquisitor character cards may be used to replace the Ambassador cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Inquisitor: Draw one character card from the Court deck and choose whether or not to exchange it with one of your face-down characters. OR Force an opponent to show you one of their character cards (their choice which). If you wish it, you may then force them to draw a new card from the Court deck. They then shuffle the old card into the Court deck. Block someone from stealing coins from you.<br/><br/><br/>",

Score points for collecting the most sushi rolls or making a full set of sashimi. Dip your favorite nigiri in wasabi to triple its value! And once you've eaten it all, finish your meal with all the pudding you've got! But be careful which sushi you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you!<br/><br/>Sushi Go! takes the card-drafting mechanism of Fairy Tale and 7 Wonders and distills it into a twenty-minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &quot;draft and pass&quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum. As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of sushi you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks. Round to round, you must also keep your eye on the goal of having the most pudding cards at the end of the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skull King is a trick-taking game similar to Oh Hell!, Wizard, Euchre and Spades, with players needing to state how many tricks they think they'll win each round. A unique element of this game is that bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. As players must win the exact number of tricks that they bid to earn points, winning too many tricks is just as bad as winning too few and this leads to intense competition where losing a trick can be as exciting as winning one.<br/><br/>Skull King uses a 66-card deck that consists of five Escape cards, four suits numbered 1-13, five Pirate cards, 1 Tigress card, and 1 Skull King card. The game lasts ten rounds, and in each round, each player is dealt as many cards as the number of the round. All players simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out a fist and on the count of three revealing a certain number of fingers (or possibly a closed fist for a bid of zero tricks).<br/><br/>Standard rules apply for the playing of cards, with one player leading off a card and other players following suit, if possible, and playing something else if not; however, a player may always choose to play one of the special, unnumbered cards &mdash; and the power of those cards might let you win a trick that otherwise would have gotten away. In more detail, the black Jolly Roger suit trumps the other three suits, a Mermaid trumps all numbered cards, a Pirate trumps the Mermaid, and the Skull King trumps everything &mdash; except if he appears in the same trick with a Mermaid, in which case she captures him and wins instead. An Escape card loses to any other card, and the Tigress card serves as either a pirate or escape card as desired by the player. Whoever wins a trick leads in the next trick.<br/><br/>If a player makes their bid exactly, they score 20 points per trick; if they collect more or fewer tricks, they lose 10 points per trick they are off. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, they win points equal to ten times the current round number &mdash; but if they take even a single trick, they lose this many points instead. If a player catches pirates with the Skull King, or the King with a mermaid, they score bonus points. Whoever has the most points after ten rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

The richest surviving gangster wins the game!<br/><br/>Ca$h 'n Guns helps you relive the best scenes of your favorite gangster movies. The goal is to have more money than anyone else after eight rounds while still being alive.<br/><br/>Each round, one player is the Boss, and he controls the pace of play. First, loot cards are revealed on the table to show what's up for grabs. Next, players load their guns by secretly selecting either a &quot;Bang!&quot; or a &quot;Click! Click!&quot; card from their hand. The Boss counts to three, and on &quot;Three&quot; each player points his foam gun at someone else; due to his status, the Boss can tell one player who's pointing a gun at him that he needs to point it in another direction. After a pause to observe threats and measure the seriousness in an opponent's eyes, the Boss counts to three again and anyone who doesn't want to risk getting shot can chicken out and remove themselves from the round.<br/><br/>Everyone who's pointing a gun at someone still in the round now reveals their card, and anyone who's the target of a &quot;Bang!&quot; takes a wound marker and gets none of the available loot. Starting with the Boss, everyone still in the round takes one loot card at a time from the table &mdash; money, diamonds, paintings, the position of Boss, medical care (to remove a wound), or a new bullet (to add a &quot;Bang!&quot; card to your hand) &mdash; until everything has been claimed.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, the game ends. Whoever has the most diamonds receives a big bonus, and paintings score based on the number of them that you've collected. Whoever has the most valuable stash wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.<br/><br/>After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.<br/><br/>Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.<br/><br/>During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.<br/><br/>Part of the Pandemic series<br/><br/>",

It's really simple!<br/><br/>Spyfall is played over several rounds, and at the start of each round all players receive cards showing the same location &mdash; a casino, a traveling circus, a pirate ship, or even a space station &mdash; except that one player receives a card that says &quot;Spy&quot; instead of the location. Players then start asking each other questions &mdash; &quot;Why are you dressed so strangely?&quot; or &quot;When was the last time we got a payday?&quot; or anything else you can come up with &mdash; trying to guess who among them is the spy. The spy doesn't know where he is, so he has to listen carefully. When it's his time to answer, he'd better create a good story!<br/><br/>At any time during a round, one player may accuse another of being a spy. If all other players agree with the accusation, the round ends and the accused player has to reveal his identity. If the spy is uncovered, all other players score points.  However, the spy can himself end a round by announcing that he understands what the secret location is; if his guess is correct, only the spy scores points.<br/><br/>After a few rounds of guessing, suspicion and bluffing, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points is victorious!<br/><br/>",

After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.<br/><br/>In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character from history with a special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and take turns performing actions by placing their dice onto the board. Players may choose from a variety of actions, each require the use of one or more dice: collecting resources or money, acquiring contracts, traveling on the map or using a special action granted by a city. When traveling, each player begins at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a player stops at a city, they place a trading post there, giving them access to extra actions or resources for the rest of the game. The higher the value of the dice used for an action, the better the options that may be chosen, but also the more money the player must pay if an opponent has already chosen the same action.<br/><br/>After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving extra victory points for having trading posts in Beijing, fulfilling the most contracts, and having trading posts in the cities on secret goal cards that each player gets at the start of the game.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which has the same German title.<br/><br/>",

Security forces were activated immediately and they arrested a suspicious young laborer near the area.<br/><br/>Mycroft Holmes, at the service of the crown, was commissioned to investigate the relationship of the young laborer with anarchist groups. He thinks it will be an easy task that he can do from the comfort of his armchair in the Diogenes Club &mdash; until he is informed of disturbing news; his younger brother Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective, has been hired by the boy's parents to prove the innocence of his son, who believes to be a scapegoat of a dark conspiracy.<br/><br/>For the first time, the brightest minds in London face each other. Was the young laborer involved in this terrible attack or he is just a scapegoat for a dark conspiracy?<br/><br/>A game of Holmes: Sherlock &amp; Mycroft lasts seven turns (days of investigation). At the beginning of each day, famous characters extracted from the books of Arthur Conan Doyle appear in London.<br/><br/>Each player has three action tokens that move from one character to another to use their special abilities, knowing that a player can never have two tokens on the same character. Therefore, a character must be freed before reuse. The abilities of each character allow them to obtain Evidence Cards or gain Investigation Tokens in multiple ways. The game has great replay value because it is not known whether a character with a specific ability will make their appearance on the board in the Day 1 or in the final Day 7. Each game is different!<br/><br/>",

Each spymaster wants their team to identify their agents first...without uncovering the assassin by mistake.<br/><br/>In Codenames, two teams compete to see who can make contact with all of their agents first. Lay out 25 cards, each bearing a single word. The spymasters look at a card showing the identity of each card, then take turns clueing their teammates. A clue consists of a single word and a number, with the number suggesting how many cards in play have some association to the given clue word. The teammates then identify one agent they think is on their team; if they're correct, they can keep guessing up to the stated number of times; if the agent belongs to the opposing team or is an innocent bystander, the team's turn ends; and if they fingered the assassin, they lose the game.<br/><br/>Spymasters continue giving clues until one team has identified all of their agents or the assassin has removed one team from play.<br/><br/>",

The rules are always the same: Take an ingredient marble from the dispenser and watch the others fall. If you connect marbles of the same color, they explode and you can take them, too! Complete your potions using the marbles you collect, and drink them to unleash their magical power. Remember, though, that to win the Student of the Year award, being quick won't be enough: you'll also need to brew the most valuable potions in Potion Explosion!<br/><br/>",

The Drow house is represented by a deck of cards, with each card being a minion in that player's deck. Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.<br/><br/>When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elementals.<br/><br/>A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed. The other resource is power, which allows you to place troops on the game board, expand your forces across the map of the Underdark, manipulate happenings in the city, and assassinate enemy troops.<br/><br/>Players gain points by controlling sites, recruiting valuable minions, promoting minions to your inner circle, and assassinating troops, and whoever ends the game with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each card features 1-3 birds in one of four colors &mdash; red, green, yellow, purple &mdash; with the reverse of the card having either the same number of birds in a different color or the same color of birds in a different number. Thus, each number+color combination appears five times in the deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a card in the grid, then flip it over. If you can add it to your collection, do so; if not, return the bird to the grid with the newly revealed side face up. Your goal is to collect sets of birds in a single color, with you needing to take the single bird first, then the pair, then the triplet. The first player to collect 2-4 sets wins, with the number being dependent on the number of players. Watch what others do, remember what was flipped where, and play the odds when deciding to flip the birds!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "High-stakes bidding on million-dollar race cars. Frantic bets placed in secret even as the cars race around the track. And to the victor, the biggest purse of all. But in the world of motor racing, the margin between victory and defeat can be a single moment: a steep banked turn, tires screaming and spitting out smoke, and the downforce, pressing you down in your seat and keeping you on the track as you make your move inside to pull ahead.<br/><br/>Downforce is a card-driven bidding, racing, and betting game for 2-6 players based on Top Race, the award-winning design by the legendary Wolfgang Kramer. Players first bid to own the six cars in the race, then they play cards from their hand to speed them around the track. However, most cards will also move their opponents' cars. So figuring out just the right time to play a card is the key to victory. Along the way, players make secret bets on who they think will win the race. Whoever has the most money from their prize money, winning bets, and remaining bank wins.<br/><br/>This is a game whose design needed no attention. Years of play and multiple versions have honed it to near perfection. On the contrary, one of the design challenges was figuring which of the many rules modules to incorporate to create the most fun version. Downforce also adds variable player powers to improve replayability. But mostly, it improves the look of the game to make it gorgeous and easy to play. Special attention was paid to the colors, the layout of the cards, the design of the cars, the details on the board, and more.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in a randomly configured modular board.<br/><br/>Initially, the rabbits are placed in their burrows and then they begin to move through the board, the possible destinations are given by the position of both rabbits. When the turn ends, and also according to the position of the rabbits, the player harvests the vegetables, unless the corresponding variety is out of stock or if the dog prevents it. At the end of the game players convert the vegetables obtained to victory points according to the scoring system used, taking into account that those varieties of vegetables that were emptied give fewer points. The player who wins the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Conejos en el huerto (Rabbits in the Garden) is a light Eurogame that is played in half an hour. Stripped completely of the random factor, it requires players to plan and make good decisions to win.<br/><br/>ESPA&Ntilde;OL<br/>El perro guardi&aacute;n deber&iacute;a hacer mejor su trabajo, la &eacute;poca de la cosecha ha llegado y el huerto ha sido invadido por conejos!!!<br/>En Conejos en el huerto los jugadores controlan una pareja de conejos, que compiten por cosechar las 5 especies de hortalizas all&iacute; cultivadas. Se juega sobre un tablero modular configurado aleatoriamente.<br/>Inicialmente los conejos se ubican en sus madrigueras y luego comienzan a moverse por turnos a trav&eacute;s del rondell. Cuando termina su turno, de acuerdo a la posici&oacute;n de los conejos, el jugador cosecha las hortalizas, excepto que la variedad correspondiente se encuentre  agotada o el perro se lo impida. Al finalizar la partida los jugadores convierten las hortalizas obtenidas a puntos de victoria de acuerdo al sistema de puntuaci&oacute;n utilizado, teniendo en cuenta que aquellas variedades de hortalizas que fueron vaciadas dan menos puntos.

To do this, he must send emissaries to negotiate with other nobles, with the Pope and with the barbarians, mobilize armies, besiege castles and win battles. The most powerful player at the time of the coronation (but not necessarily the new king) will be the winner of the match.<br/><br/>In this game, players take turn to take two actions among moving their armies in a map, besieging neutral/opponent castles to earn power and get prisoners, attach adjacent armies, send emissaries to pope and barbarians also to increase the power or draw cards that have various effects, mainly improving the other actions.<br/>Each player has a secret objective that can give a bonus: To make another player (or perhaps himself) king. <br/>At the end of the game, triggered when a player gets the crown, the noble with more points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The king, awestruck by the interior beauty of the Alhambra, immediately ordered that his own palace in Portugal be decorated with similar wall tiles. As a tile-laying artist, you have been challenged to embellish the walls of the Royal Palace of Evora.<br/><br/>In the game Azul, players take turns drafting colored tiles from suppliers to their player board. Later in the round, players score points based on how they've placed their tiles to decorate the palace. Extra points are scored for specific patterns and completing sets; wasted supplies harm the player's score. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

In a level, each player receives a hand of cards equal to the number of the level: one card in level 1, two cards in level 2, etc. Collectively you must play these cards into the center of the table on a single discard pile in ascending order but you cannot communicate with one another in any way as to which cards you hold. You simply stare into one another's eyes, and when you feel the time is right, you play your lowest card. If no one holds a card lower than what you played, great, the game continues! If someone did, all players discard face up all cards lower than what you played, and you lose one life.<br/><br/>You start the game with a number of lives equal to the number of players. Lose all your lives, and you lose the game. You start with one shuriken as well, and if everyone wants to use a shuriken, each player discards their lowest card face up, giving everyone information and getting you closer to completing the level. As you complete levels, you might receive a reward of a shuriken or an extra life. Complete all the levels, and you win!<br/><br/>For an extra challenge, play The Mind in extreme mode with all played cards going onto the stack face down.

At the start of the game each player gets dealt 5 cards, which he is not allowed to change the order of.<br/><br/>In each round players take turns that consist of 3 actions:<br/><br/>1. Choose either the left or right most card to play to the discard pile.<br/><br/>According to the played card move, one adventurer that many tiles forward towards the tomb. An adventurer only moves from tile to tile, jumping over empty spaces and not counting them.<br/><br/>2. When the adventurer has completed his movement, he performs the action of that tile, if possible. Depending on the tile this can have various effects:<br/><br/>Treasure tile - If enough of a players adventurers player are placed on a tile, the player can collect that tile and earn points for it. Additionally he keeps the tile, trying to collect treasure sets consisting of the three different treasure kinds, vase, statue and necklace.<br/><br/>Horus tile - The player can either gain a key or a Horus Card. He will need the key to enter the tomb and the special Horus card offers unique and strong ways to move his adventurers once he plays that card.<br/><br/>Osiris tile - The tile acts as an catapult instantly moving the adventurer a certain amount of tiles forward.<br/><br/>Temple tile - On these tiles players get special bonuses, like scarabs that are worth victory points or joker tiles, which complete treasure sets. The most unique tile is the tunnel. If an adventurer lands on a tunnel he instantly gets teleported to the next tunnel in play, creating a shortcut through the temple.<br/><br/>3. After performing the action of the tile, players draw one card from the draw pile to refill their hand to five cards. The drawn card is placed in the middle of the hand.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players can chose to move one of 2 adventurers. Every time an adventurer crosses over an Anubis statue for the first time he gains a new adventurer which is placed at the start.<br/><br/>The game ends once two adventurers reach the tomb.

        "description": "Impact: Battle of Elements, a reimplementation of Strike, challenges players to knock one another from the game by rolling their dice well and using the special powers available to them.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with five dice, with one side being blank and the other five sides showing an elemental symbol. On a turn, a player rolls one die into the arena, which is set inside the bottom of the box. If any two or more dice show the same symbol, that player then claims those dice and their turn ends. If a die shows a blank face, it's removed from play; if no symbols match, then the player can end their turn or throw another die in the arena.<br/><br/>If the arena is empty at the start of your turn, then you must throw all of your dice into the arena, hoping to claim some back because if you ever run out of dice, then you're out of the game. Whoever last holds dice wins!<br/><br/>Impact: Battle of Elements includes a variant in which each of the symbols has a special power, and when you make a match, you get to use the power of that symbol.<br/><br/>",

In case of a right answer, the players score 1 point. In case of wrong answer, they lose the current card as well as the top card of the deck. Thus losing 2 points. In case of lack of answer, the players only lose the current card, and therefore only 1 point.<br/><br/>You have the choice &ndash; make the difference!<br/><br/>Small Historical Point:<br/><br/>Originally, Just One was called We Are The Word and was published by Fun Consortium.<br/><br/>Repos Production bought the rights in early 2018 and adapted the game.

With you having no idea which words are &quot;traps&quot;, it&rsquo;s like dancing on a minefield, when you&rsquo;re trying to describe your assigned word to the rest of the team.<br/><br/>You take the role of a group of adventurers crawling through a fantasy dungeon full of traps and curses, with a Boss waiting for you at the end.<br/>You have to successfully guess a word that one of your teammates is trying to describe to you. Sounds simple, but it is made fiendishly difficult by not knowing which words you can't say. Because both teams are simultaneously preparing secret traps for each other, words that you can't use. And further you get, the more trapwords you might expect.<br/><br/>Let's see the example of one possible turn when you are trying to give clues for the word &quot;Axe&quot;:<br/><br/>You: &quot;It is a thing that a dwarf can&hellip;&quot;<br/>Opponents team: &quot;A-ha, dwarf! Gotcha!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;How did you know that? Was it obvious I will use that?&quot;<br/><br/>Or when you would try another approach it could look like this, the successful turn of your team:<br/><br/>You: &quot;This thing is used by a man with a beard, in a checkered shirt....&quot;<br/>One of your teammates: &quot;A coffee maker?&quot;<br/>[Everyone laughs]<br/>You: &quot;He uses it for work in nature.&quot;<br/>Another teammate: &quot;A chainsaw!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;He makes smaller pieces from a big plant with it.&quot;<br/>Any of your teammate: &quot;An axe!&quot;<br/>You: &quot;Yes!

Teams take turns rotating a dial to where they think a hidden bullseye is located on a spectrum. One of the players on your team &mdash; the Psychic &mdash; knows exactly where the bullseye is, and draws a card with a pair of binaries on it (such as: Job - Career, Rough - Smooth, Fantasy - Sci-Fi, Sad Song - Happy Song, etc). The Psychic must then provide a clue that is *conceptually* where the bullseye is located between those two binaries.<br/><br/>For example, if the card this round is HOT-COLD and the bullseye is slightly to the &quot;cold&quot; side of the centre, the Psychic needs to give a clue somewhere in that region. Perhaps &quot;salad&quot;?<br/><br/>After the Psychic gives their clue, their team discusses where they think the bullseye is located and turns the dial to that location on that spectrum. The closer to the center of the bullseye the team guess, the more points they score!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Castles of Burgundy is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing, they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.<br/><br/>The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom, which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.<br/><br/>The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds. Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles. At the beginning of each round, all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die. A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die. During each round, players take their turns in the current turn order. During their turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of their dice and place it in the staging area on their player board.<br/>    Place a settlement tile from the staging area of their player board to a space on their player board with a number matching one of their dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile.<br/>    Deliver goods with a number matching one of their dice.<br/>    Take worker tokens that allow the player to adjust the roll of their dice.<br/><br/><br/>In addition to these actions, a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on their player board. If an action triggers the awarding of victory points, those points are immediately recorded. Each settlement tile offers a benefit: additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points. Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last player finishes their turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase. Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers and for undelivered goods. Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The 2019 edition of The Castles of Burgundy includes eight expansions, seven of which were previously released as promotional items and one new to this release (Shields).<br/>This edition has one fewer double-sided Monastery boards than what came in The Castles of Burgundy: 4th Expansion \u2013 Monastery Boards. It doesn't include The Castles of Burgundy: 1st Expansion \u2013 New Player Boards, The Castles of Burgundy: 3rd Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2013, or The Castles of Burgundy: 7th Expansion \u2013 German Board Game Championship Board 2016. However it includes one new player board (x4) that had never been released before (Board 2).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Letter Jam is a 2-6 player cooperative word game where players assist each other in composing meaningful words from letters around the table. The trick is holding the letter card so that it&rsquo;s only visible to other players and not to you.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player receives a set of face-down letter cards that can be arranged to form an existing word. The setup can be prepared by using a special card scanning app, or by players selecting words for each other. Each player then puts their first card in their stand facing the other players without looking at it, and the game begins.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns. Each turn, players simultaneously search other players&rsquo; letters to see what words they can spell out (telling the others the length of the word they can make up). The player who offers the longest word can then be chosen as the clue giver.<br/><br/>The clue giver spells out their clue by putting numbered tokens in front of the other players. Number one goes to the player whose letter comes first in the clue, number two to the second letter etc. They can always use a wild card which can be any letter, but they cannot tell others which letter it represents.<br/><br/>Each player with a numbered token (or tokens) in front of them then tries to figure out what their letter is. If they do, they place the card face down before revealing the next letter.  At the end of the game, players can then rearrange the cards to try to form an existing word. All players then reveal their cards to see if they were successful or not. The more players who have an existing word in front of them, the bigger their collective success.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Magazynier, 2-4 players compete to build the most successful produce stand in the market from eight cards that they'll place turn by turn. Each card contains six spots in a 2x3 layout, with those spots containing strawberries, bananas, grapes, carrots, mushrooms, an empty pallet, or rats. On a turn, play the card in your hand or a card of your choice from the row of three cards into your personal layout. You can overlap the cards as you wish so long as you retain a grid structure to how they're laid out. If you played from your hand, you draft a face-up card to end your turn, then reveal a new card.<br/><br/>When each player has placed eight cards, the game ends. Players score points for the largest group of the good of their choice, but the rest of the players also score this good, so try to dominate one type of good for yourself while also building up goods that others will score. Your score for a good is the number of distinct groups of that good multiplied by the number of crates in your largest group of that good. Empty pallets are worth 0 points, and rats are -2 points, so you better cover them up to keep from scaring customers! Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Using the ramps lets you pass other cars and move more efficiently, so managing your hand of speed cards to take advantage of them is crucial.<br/><br/>&bull; Savanna Stretch features wild animals that traverse the track, blocking the way. They move ahead after a car passes them, making the track more difficult to navigate for the lead car, and opening up for the trailing cars, so it can pay to hang back a bit before making your move.<br/><br/>These new tracks add a little more strategy to the game, offering Downforce veterans a whole new play experience.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in 10 rounds, each with four phases.<br/><br/><br/>     High Council Phase -- This is a negotiation phase where Nations will convene to decide how they will respond to an event occurring back on Earth or on the Exoplanet. The top card is drawn from the High Council deck. Nations then decide to respond to the event by assigning the specified Team Member to the event, keeping them from use during the rest of the round. If all Nations respond then everyone gets the bonus. If not, there's a penalty for those that ignored it.<br/>     Supply Depot Phase -- This is an auction phase where Nations bid on Supply Depot cards or the first player marker. Players choose cards in the order of their bids. The player with the highest bid may take a second delivery. <br/>     Action Phase -- This is a worker placement phase. Nations place Team Members in Action Spaces to take various actions and earn prestige. <br/>     Resolution Phase -- In this phase, the Nations produce new resources and return their Team Members home. <br/><br/><br/>Points -- Prestige is gained on 4 tracks (Defense, Exploration, Commerce, and Infrastructure) and your position on these tracks gains you points at the end of the game. You may also gain points by achieving Civilization Milestones (only 1 Nation may claim each Milestone), completing Lunar Season scoring cards (any number of Nations may complete these), building ancient XenoRelics, completing special objective cards, and for left over resources.<br/><br/>The Nation with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cascadia is a puzzly tile-laying and token-drafting game featuring the habitats and wildlife of the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>In the game, you take turns building out your own terrain area and populating it with wildlife. You start with three hexagonal habitat tiles (with the five types of habitat in the game), and on a turn you choose a new habitat tile that's paired with a wildlife token, then place that tile next to your other ones and place the wildlife token on an appropriate habitat. (Each tile depicts 1-3 types of wildlife from the five types in the game, and you can place at most one tile on a habitat.) Four tiles are on display, with each tile being paired at random with a wildlife token, so you must make the best of what's available &mdash; unless you have a nature token to spend so that you can pick your choice of each item.<br/><br/>Ideally you can place habitat tiles to create matching terrain that reduces fragmentation and creates wildlife corridors, mostly because you score for the largest area of each type of habitat at game's end, with a bonus if your group is larger than each other player's. At the same time, you want to place wildlife tokens so that you can maximize the number of points scored by them, with the wildlife goals being determined at random by one of the four scoring cards for each type of wildlife. Maybe hawks want to be separate from other hawks, while foxes want lots of different animals surrounding them and bears want to be in pairs. Can you make it happen?<br/><br/>",

Things are moving full speed ahead too, the possibilities are enormous because this is 1977, the year when lunar living becomes reality. The most enterprising companies have decided to sponsor teams of scientists, builders, publicists and freelance nightlife entertainers to set out to construct the best client base in the galaxy. On top of this out of the world chance, the Lunar Colonization Authority shall assign the capital of the Moon to the best of the projects that are presented, making the chance for an even juicier reward!<br/><br/>In LUNA Capital, the players must optimally manage the elements of the game to build the best possible lunar settlement, and to make it worthy of becoming the capital of the entire off-planet colony. They will have a series of construction cards in a common &ldquo;market&rdquo;, and each of the players shall be tied to a number of project tiles. The players take turns drawing cards and the tiles that accompany them, and then place them in their personal playing area. The cards must be laid out in a maximum of three lines and must be placed so that they are always in ascending numerical value. Once the card has been placed, the tiles are then put on the spaces for them on the cards, in an attempt to group together the various projects in the most efficient way possible.<br/><br/>The tiles show what projects are available, all of which are essential for the construction of the city worthy of the term. They include oxygen collectors, greenhouses, residential complexes and (of extreme importance) sales offices to sell apartments with the best views in the galaxy. Each of these categories scores according to how they are arranged within the personal area of each player. Whoever is able to best take advantage of their arrangement and placement shall become the mayor of LUNA Capital.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

EL reloj de arena deber&aacute; ocupar tambi&eacute;n el centro de la mesa junto a las tarjetas durante toda la partida.<br/><br/>C&Oacute;MO JUGAR: Comienza el juego el m&aacute;s joven del grupo. Su compa&ntilde;ero de la derecha tomar&aacute; la 1er tarjeta del mazo y le ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; la imagen del acertijo sin mostrarle la respuesta, e inmediatamente dar&aacute; vuelta el reloj. Si el jugador deduce el acertijo (concepto, frase o palabra) antes de que se cumpla el tiempo, se quedar&aacute; con la tarjeta y obtiene 1 punto. Si no responde correctamente, la tarjeta se devuelve al fondo del mazo, sin que se muestre la respuesta. La ronda contin&uacute;a en el sentido de las agujas del reloj de la misma forma con el resto de los jugadores.<br/><br/>TARJETAS &quot;QU&Eacute; VES PARA TODOS&quot; (para todos los jugadores): Qu&eacute; ves incluye un conjunto de tarjetas que est&aacute;n marca-das con EL REY en color rojo. En caso que a un jugador le toque una de ellas, perder&aacute; la oportunidad de descifrar esa tarjeta en esa ronda y deber&aacute; mostrarla al resto de los participantes. Luego de dar vuelta el reloj, el primero en responder correctamente se lleva la tarjeta obteniendo 1 punto. <br/>En cambio, si ninguno de los participantes logra descifrar el acertijo, se lleva la tarjeta el jugador que la extrajo del mazo y suma 1 punto.<br/><br/>&iquest;QUI&Eacute;N ES EL GANADOR? El primer jugador en descifrar 4 acertijos y obtener 4 puntos, es el ganador.<br/><br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: Be the first player to decipher 4 riddles.<br/><br/>PREPARATION: The deck (all 200 cards) is shuffled and placed in the center of the table with the riddles facing up. The hourglass must also occupy the center of the table, next to the cards, throughout the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: The youngest player begins the game. The player to his/her right will take the top card from the deck and show him/her the picture-riddle, without showing him/her the answer, and will immediately turn the hourglass. If the player deciphers the riddle (concept, phrase or word) before the time is up, s/he will keep the card and get 1 point. If he does not answer correctly, the card is returned to the bottom of the deck, without the answer being shown. The round continues clockwise in the same way with the rest of the players.<br/><br/>&quot;WHAT YOU SEE, FOR EVERYONE&quot; CARDS: The game includes a set of cards that are marked with the king in RED. If a player gets one of them, s/he will lose the opportunity to decipher that card in that round and must instead show it to the rest of the players. After turning the hourglass, the first player to answer correctly takes the card, obtaining 1 point. On the other hand, if none of the players manages to decipher the puzzle, the player who extracted the card from the deck takes it and gets 1 point for him/herself.<br/><br/>WHO IS THE WINNER?: The first player to decipher 4 puzzles (get 4 points) is the winner.<br/><br/>-from the game's official rulebook<br/><br/>",

The first team to figure out the secret object wins!<br/><br/>To set up Phantom Ink, divide players so that the Sun team and the Moon team each have one Spirit and up to three Mediums. The mediums on a team share a hand of seven question cards, and the spirits begin the game by choosing one of the five objects on a card as the secret object. On a turn, the mediums pass two question cards to their spirit, with sample questions like &quot;What color is it most commonly?&quot;, &quot;What fictional character has it or uses it?&quot;, and &quot;If it were a musical instrument, what would it be?&quot;<br/><br/>The spirit discards one question card face up, then returns the question card it's going to answer to their mediums, then slowly writes the answer one letter at a time for all to see. As soon as the mediums think they know what this clue word is, they yell &quot;Silencio&quot;, and the spirit stops writing. The other team of mediums might see only the letter &quot;Y&quot;, but if you know the question is &quot;What color is it?&quot;, then you know the clue must be &quot;yellow&quot;. To end your turn, draw two new question cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, instead of handing over question cards, you can attempt to guess the answer &mdash; and to do so you write like the spirits, one letter at a time.

        "description": "In Reiner Knizia's Mille Fiori (millefiori is a glasswork technique for decorative patterns, the name means Thousand Flowers), you take the role of glass manufacturers and traders who want to profit as much as they can from their role in the production of fine glass art.<br/><br/>The game board features different aspects of the glass production cycle: workshops where the glass is created, houses where it's installed, people who support your work, trade shops where it's sold, and the harbor where ships take the glass to faraway locations. You want to be present in all of these areas, preferably at just the right time to maximize your earnings. The gameboard features 109 spaces, with one card in the deck for each of those spaces.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives a hand of five cards. Each player chooses a card from hand, then passes the remaining cards to the next player, then each player plays their card in turn, beginning with the round's start player and typically placing a diamond-shaped token of their color in the location depicted on that card:<br/><br/><br/>     In the Workshops, you score 1 point for each of your tokens in a connected group with the newly placed token, doubling that score if you played on a pigment field.<br/>     In the Residences, you score the listed number of points, and if your token is preceded in the line by one or more tokens of your color, you score those previously played tokens again.<br/>     In the Townspeople area, you score 1, 3 or 6 points based on the height of your token in the pyramids, but you can only place at higher levels if the lower spaces are filled. Double your points if the card symbol matches the space your filled. Supporting tokens score again as higher tokens are placed.<br/>     In the Trade shops, four types of goods are present, and when you place a token, each token on that goods type scores for its owner points equal to the number of goods of that type now covered.<br/>     In the Harbor, you move your ship equal to the number on the played card, scoring points based on the space where you land, then place a token in one of the five rows. When that row is filled with three ships, each token in that row scores for its owner 1/3/6/10 points depending on the number of trade goods in that row.<br/><br/><br/>Alternatively, you can play a card for ship movement points and not place a token on the game board.<br/><br/>Each player plays four cards in a round (in a 3 or 4 player game), then adds the last card in hand to those displayed beside the game board, then the start player marker rotates and you begin a new round.<br/><br/>For each of the five areas, you can meet a certain condition that allows you to play a bonus card from those beside the game board, e.g., in the Workshops when you place the third card that surrounds a bonus card symbol, or in the Trade shops when you score a goods type that gives someone else more points than you. When you play a bonus card, you might trigger another bonus card... and then another!<br/><br/>Additionally, there are five different ways to score substantial bonus points for the areas, e.g., in the Residences you need to place tokens on houses of four different values, and in the Townspeople area you need to place tokens on all three types in a pyramid. You can only score each area's bonus once, and importantly each time a bonus is claimed then the value available for later players is reduced.<br/><br/>When someone has placed their final diamond token or when you can't deal a new hand of five cards to each player, then the game ends and the player with the most successful glass dynasty (most points) is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Place one card from the deck letter side up and another color side up. When the timer starts, everybody plays at the same time. You can play a letter on the letter pile as long as you can name something that starts with that letter and that &quot;matches&quot; the current color showing; similarly, you can play a color on the color pile as long as you can name something of that color that starts with the letter atop the letter pile. For example, when playing a &quot;B&quot; card next to a yellow card, you could say &quot;Banana!&quot;, and when playing an orange card next to an &quot;L&quot;, you could say &quot;Lion!&quot; You can't repeat a word previously given, and you can't name the color of the color card.<br/><br/>Whenever you want, you can say &quot;Roger!&quot;, and all players must flip the cards in their hand, so letters become colors and vice versa. Alternatively, you can say &quot;Over!&quot;, and players pass their cards to the left.<br/><br/>When time runs out, you gain points equal to the number of stars on played letter cards, then subtract 1 point for each unplayed card.

If the two cards show the same number, continue your turn; if they do not, return the cards to where they came from and end your turn.<br/><br/>If you reveal three cards showing the same number, take these cards as a set in front of you. If you are the first player to collect three sets, you win &mdash; except that a player wins immediately if they collect the set of 7s or two sets that add or subtract to 7, e.g., 4s and 11s.<br/><br/>Note that nana and Trio contain identical components, but nana is labeled for 2-5 players, while Trio is labeled for 3-6 players. Trio has slight changes to the rules, with players using all cards no matter the player count. Additionally, you play in normal mode &mdash; winning with three sets or the 7s &mdash; or &quot;spicy&quot; mode, winning with two linked sets or the 7s. Finally, Trio includes rules for playing in teams with four or six players.<br/><br/>",

In this game players will take turns choosing the Cactus card with the prettiest flowers they want to bring over to their collection. Before taking the card they&rsquo;ll need to indicate which side of the card they will touch, and then flip it handling only that side of the card. If the reverse is clear on that side, they can take the card and score that number of flowers. If the reverse shows a cactus full of thorns, they will lose the card.<br/><br/>As soon as someone manages to keep eight cards (or the deck runs out), players will count the number of flowers they&rsquo;ve managed to collect.

The city is run by moneybags, though, and now it's time to seize opportunities as swindlers and cutpurses to claim your share of their wealth.<br/><br/>Swindler combines press-your-luck with take-that mechanisms for a fun and thematic game set in Victorian London. Each round, players must steal from one of the five moneybags, drawing tokens from the chosen bag. Each bag is filled with coins, jewelry, and other loot &mdash; but each bag also contains at least one skull! If you draw a skull, you've pressed your luck too far and got caught in the act. Not only will you lose the loot you stole that round, you also lose everything you stole from the same bag in previous rounds. The moneybag not only found your hand in their pocket, but they also recognized the small but precious ring on your finger...<br/><br/>It's wise not to sit on the loot too long in case you get caught. Dealers will pay you for the loot you turn in, giving you points. You can also use your loot to complete orders, but one of your fellow swindlers might be faster and push you aside to complete a task, costing you valuable points. Thankfully, you don't have to swindle on your own! Hire accomplices to gain advantages or affect the other players with disadvantages.<br/><br/>The player with the most points after a set number of rounds will be recognized as the most notorious swindler of London and thus win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You've been tasked by the city council to put together a plan to transform a whole neighborhood in the city. You have the opportunity to build new housing, office buildings, parks, and leisure areas near the waterfront. It is in your hands to make the city a better place.<br/><br/>Cities is a city-building game in which you draft the best projects and arrange them in your own playing area. With action and resource draft mechanisms, it will give you the opportunity to visit the cities of Sydney, Venice, New York, Barcelona, Rio de Janeiro, Lisbon, Mexico City, and Buenos Aires. Can you design the most magnificent neighborhood?<br/><br/>The game is played over eight rounds (or four rounds in a two-player game). Each round, players use their workers to collect 1 scoring card, 1 city tile, 1-2 feature tiles, and 2-4 building pieces. City tiles are made up of park spaces, water spaces, and building spaces. Building pieces are placed on building spaces of the same color to form buildings, which can be 1-4 stories high. Whenever a player fulfills an achievement, they place one of their discs on the achievement board. At the end of the game, players add up the points they have gained from all of their scoring cards and achievements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
